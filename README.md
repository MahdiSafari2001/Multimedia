In multimedia task one, I learned how to create a GUI in python, record and save my voice and capture and sotre my picture by webcam in python. In addition, I was able to send those data to another platform like laptop as a server and receive those as a client. 
In another task, I gained some knowledge about how to use OpenCV in order to manipulate images like rotation, flipping, shearing, scaling and translation. Moreover, I learned how to enhance and sharpen images implementing some functions and filters.
